Image classification of hand drawn pictures 

"Google has collected a series of hand-drawn images corresponding to a number of categories in their *Quick, Draw!* project. 
We provide a dataset which is a modified subset of this dataset.

The dataset at your disposal contains images that aren't always centered and straight, neither are they free of noisy artifacts. Some of the images are composed of just noise, and the classifier need to identify such empty pictures too."

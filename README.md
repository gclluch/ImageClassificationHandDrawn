Image classification of hand drawn pictures - re-do of a course project

A group project I worked on for the graduate course COMP 551 (applied machine learning) at McGill.
I was responsible for image preprocessing and our convolutional neural networks.

This is a re-work of that project, where I will doing all data exploration, preprocessing, baseline establishment, and final classification from the ground up.

All of this code is 100% mine and will updated as I try to achieve high accuracy with various classifiers.

"Google has collected a series of hand-drawn images corresponding to a number of categories in their *Quick, Draw!* project. 
We provide a dataset which is a modified subset of this dataset.

The dataset at your disposal contains images that aren't always centered and straight, neither are they free of noisy artifacts. Some of the images are composed of just noise, and the classifier need to identify such empty pictures too. 
We provide a set of labeled training data (images and target outputs) as well as a set of unlabeled test data (i.e. images only). 
Your task is to correctly classify all images of the test set, and submit your classifications through Kaggle."
